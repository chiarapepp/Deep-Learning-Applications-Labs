# Deep Learning Applications Laboratory Assignments

This repository contains the implementation of three laboratory assignments developed for as part of the exam for a **Deep Learning Applications** course.

Each lab is organized in a dedicated folder and includes all the code required to reproduce the experiments and results. Inside each folder, a `README.md` file provides details specific for each experiments, visualizations, and explanations of the design choices made, along with references and sources of inspiration.

To complement the code and documentation, full training logs and results are available through public Weights & Biases (W&B) project pages.

## Lab Overviews

### **Laboratory 1 - Deep Neural Networks: MLPs, ResMLPs, and CNNs**

This lab explores the impact of residual connections on deep network training, reproducing key findings from:

> [**Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) ‚Äì Kaiming He et al., CVPR 2016

Additionally, the lab includes a fine tuning experiment with different layer freezing strategies and a SVM baselinge comparison using extracted features.

### Laboratory 2 ‚Äî Deep Reinforcement Learning : REINFORCE on CartPole & LunarLander

This lab features a comprehensive implementation of the **REINFORCE algorithm**, based on:

> [**Simple Statistical Gradient-Following Algorithms for Connectionist Reinforcement Learning**](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00992696#citeas) ‚Äì Williams, 1992

It is applied to two environments from [Gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/):

- [CartPole-v1](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/classic_control/cart_pole/)
- [LunarLander-v3](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/box2d/lunar_lander/)

### Laboratory 3 - Working with Transformers in the HuggingFace Ecosystem

Comprehensive exploration of transformer fine-tuning using the HuggingFace ecosystem, implementing both full fine-tuning and LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) approaches.

Based on [HuggingFace Transformers Documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/)
